## Dev env setup

Recommended IDE Setup \
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).

- This setup assumes you have rust installed. If you don't please visit [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Also please make sure you have the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) dependencies that are required by Tauri
- Download the required libmpv dlls/libs as per your platform   
    - For ðŸªŸ Windows dll's are available [here](https://github.com/shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake/releases) by shinchiro. If needed please place them in your target folder generated by tauri as the same level as the `tokei.exe`
    - For Linux installing this `libmpv-dev` should just work
    - For MacOS one might need `brew install mpv`
- Configure the path in `build.rs` if needed


```sh
git clone https://github.com/sakshatshinde/tokei.git
cd tokei/
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```
